# Plot of modes accessible to different experimental techniques.

Remake of the Fig 5 from Font-Ribera et al 1308.4164, really Pat McDonald's child.

This plot show modes accessible to different experimental techniques. The axis are not labelled, but they should be viewed as logarithmish. As always, these simplified plots never git the full picture, but can explain why some cross-correlations are more useful than the others. 

Some comments:
 * Both Lyman-alpha forest and 21-cm suffer for more-or-less irreducible low k-par cut. In the former due to continuum fitting in the latter due to foreground removal. Some of this information can be recovered through gravity induces squeezed bispectrum, see e.g. http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.03625v1.
 * 21-cm has in addition the low k-perp cut corresponding to the shortest baseline. If the single-dish operation can be performed in addition to the interferometic data, this can be recovered.
 * we also show dashed line to remind us of the 21-cm "wedge". Note that with a well-filled u-v plane, there is nothing fundamental about the "wedge"
 * All the experiments also have the low k_perp cut to some extend not shown, for example there is a limit on how well we can understand the selection function in galaxy surveys on large scales in the presence of galaxy reddening, air mass, etc.
 * Most importantly, it this plot doesn't show dollars/mode, dollars/linear mode and how well these modes are measured at all. For example, from this plot it is clear that lya-forest has lots and lots of modes, which is true, but many are deeply non-linear and many are measured very noisily.
